*look at the "server.js" file in this example. Notice at the bottom of
the file how it has "const userRoute = require(/routes/user);", and then
in the /routes/user file it has "user = require(../..models/user)". This
is how the Model (database files) interact with the Controller (router)

app.js file) and that's where the mongoose.connect() is located*
